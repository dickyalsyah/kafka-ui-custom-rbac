#### UI for Apache Kafka is a free, open-source web UI to monitor and manage Apache Kafka clusters.

UI for Apache Kafka is a simple tool that makes your data flows observable, helps find and troubleshoot issues faster and deliver optimal performance. Its lightweight dashboard makes it easy to track key metrics of your Kafka clusters - Brokers, Topics, Partitions, Production, and Consumption.

# Getting Started

To run UI for Apache Kafka, you can use either a pre-built Docker image or build it (or a jar file) yourself.

## Quick start (Demo run)

```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_ENABLED=true provectuslabs/kafka-ui
```

Then access the web UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

The command is sufficient to try things out. When you're done trying things out, you can proceed with a [persistent installation](https://docs.kafka-ui.provectus.io/quick-start/persistent-start)

## Persistent installation

```
services:
  kafka-ui:
    container_name: kafka-ui
    image: provectuslabs/kafka-ui:latest
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
